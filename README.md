Your ListView must have Context menu items for "More Info" and "Delete". 
The "More Info" button must navigate the user to a new page, where more information is displayed about the item and a link to find even more info is present. So you can use the same url from homework 4 but now utilize a button instead of "Tapped" event. The more info page should utilize binding. You should not make an individual page for each list view item. 
The "Delete" Context menu item should actually remove the specific list view item from your item. 
Your list view should also implement PullToRefresh which will bring any deleted ListView items back into the ListView. 
Your assignment utilize collections that allow for automatic UI updating.
